1. Different functions for the same tabs (profile, project): As a user, I am informed about being in the profile or project tab, both when checking my own profile/project, as well as being on other people's profiles/projects. This action misleads the recipient and makes navigation in the application less clear. Recommendation: Separating user’s profile/projects in the menu from the preview of others. In the case of viewing other people's profiles, the suggested marking of the collaboration tab (or, if created, suggesting a list of profiles/projects on the platform)
2. Duplication of functions from the main menu: Duplication of the same tabs in the main and drop-down menu, which may mislead the recipient (y suggesting that there are two tabs for the profile and projects)
3. Duplication of items in the menu and a different visual style: Introducing a dual menu, especially in the mobile version (where both are under development), may mislead the recipient (by suggesting that there are two tabs for the profile and projects). Recommendation: Leaving one main menu in mobile version, with all features
4. Lack of possibility to close the account from the app: It is not possible to delete the account in the current version of the application, which is against the law in force in the European Union and the United States (the right to delete the processing of personal data on the platform at any time). Recommendation: Adding option to delete account (by user or by contacting the user)
5. Lack information about why we’re suggesting profiles: Dashboard, in accordance with generally accepted assumptions, should concern the most important information for the recipient. In the current version as a user, I do not know on why and on what basis the selected profiles are displayed. Also data seems to duplicate with “collaborators “ section (due displaying profiles despite not being added to any project). Recommendation: Determining the main purpose of the dashboard and connecting the suggested profiles with the collaborators section.
6. Test profiles on the first view of the application: Displaying test profiles on the first screen that the user sees negatively affects the professional reception of the solution.Suggestion for MVP: A specific list of profiles displayed as suggested in the MVP version, without test profiles.
7. Informing the user about the need to perform an action: As a user, I know what I have to do to activate the action. Pattern to be repeated in other subpages.
8. Button suggesting an action, despite the impossibility of performing it: Button suggesting the possibility of creating a project, despite clear communication about the need to connect the wallet first. In addition, a change of the screen in the event of clicking the button with the communication of the next required action (the screen that should apply to already connected users). Suggestion for MVP: Remove the button preview for unconnected users
