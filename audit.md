1. Different functions for the same tabs (profile, project): As a user, I am informed about being in the profile or project tab, both when checking my own profile/project, as well as being on other people's profiles/projects. This action misleads the recipient and makes navigation in the application less clear. Recommendation: Separating userâ€™s profile/projects in the menu from the preview of others. In the case of viewing other people's profiles, the suggested marking of the collaboration tab (or, if created, suggesting a list of profiles/projects on the platform)
3. Duplication of functions from the main menu: Duplication of the same tabs in the main and drop-down menu, which may mislead the recipient (y suggesting that there are two tabs for the profile and projects)
